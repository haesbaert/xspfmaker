NAME
       xspfmaker - make xspf playlists

SYNOPSIS
       xspfmaker [--input-file=INPUTFILE] [--output-file=OUTPUTFILE]
       [--title-format=FMT] [OPTION]… [PATHS]…

DESCRIPTION
       xspfmaker creates xspf playlists of media files to be used in players
       like vlc(1). Each path in PATHS is traversed and scanned for suitable
       files. A list of PATHS as one per line can also be read from stdin by
       not passing it any PATHS or passing it a -. See the EXAMPLES section.

ARGUMENTS
       PATHS
           List of PATHS to be traversed. All files in the subtree will be
           considered for the playlist by querying its duration via ffmpeg.
           Discarded files are printed out on stderr.

OPTIONS
       -i INPUTFILE, --input-file=INPUTFILE
           Input file with a list of one path per line to be to be used in
           addition to PATHS.

       -o OUTPUTFILE, --output-file=OUTPUTFILE
           Output file to be used instead of stdout.

       -t FMT, --title-format=FMT (absent=filename)
           Specifies the format of the title of each track, FMT must be
           either path or filename. If path the title is the complete file
           path. If filename just the actual filename is used as the title.
           If empty or -, read a list of one path per line from stdin.

COMMON OPTIONS
       --help[=FMT] (default=auto)
           Show this help in format FMT. The value FMT must be one of auto,
           pager, groff or plain. With auto, the format is pager or plain
           whenever the TERM env var is dumb or undefined.

EXIT STATUS
       xspfmaker exits 0 on success, and > 0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
       Create a xspf list from two directories a single file:
       $ xspfmaker ~/videos ~/nudes.mp4 /mnt/oldvids > playlist.xspf

       or the equivalent:
       $ xspfmaker -o playlist.xspf ~/videos ~/nudes.mp4 /mnt/oldvids

       or the equivalent getting the list from stdin:
       $ printf "~/videos\n~/nudes.mp4\n/mnt/oldvids" | xspfmaker -o
       playlist.xspf

       or the equivalent but parsing the list from a file:
       $ printf "~/videos\n~/nudes.mp4\n/mnt/oldvids" > list &&
       xspfmaker -o playlist.xspf -i list
